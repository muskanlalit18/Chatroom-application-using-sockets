# Chatroom application using Socket programming in Python

This repo consists of two scripts: server.py and client.py

The server.py script needs to be executed once to create a server. It establishes connections with the clients that connect to it using IPv4 and a Port address.


The client side script can be used to create as many clients as needed. In the client.py file, uncomment ```message = '' ``` and comment out the line before this to execute it as a reader and chatroom script that shows all the conversations on that server.
